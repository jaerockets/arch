<p style="text-indent:3em;">as I sauntered down Hillcrest's Fifth Avenue with my friend yesterday, after popping into a thrift shop where I found an awesome Space Jam Bugs Bunny hoodie, I couldn't help but notice the 3-stack of vinyl bins sitting out front of a shop. I poked through them as I usually do whenever I see vinyls, nothing particularly standing out. As I peered into the shop which had placed these records out, my brain promptly turned off. The sight I laid witness to was one so magnificent as to be difficult to capture in essence with mere words. This little 2-hallway record store was crammed with as many vinyls, CDs, cassettes, DVDs, and other miscellania as the poor little shelves could hold. 
	Without an extended amount of time afforded to me, I made a quick loop around the venue. Punk blasting out of the corner stereo, a singular employee who looked straight out of the local American Idiot theatre production from OB Playhouse barely visible at the counter behind piles of before-you-go merchandise, an overwhelming selection of physical media before me, I resigned myself to simply soaking in the energy that only ~90s-era technology can provide. Am I alone in finding inherent joy from the presence of endless rows of CDs, each one as foreign as the last, begging me to find the diamond in the rough?; In flipping through LPs, looking for Jazz Classics and geeking out over seeing the life-size physical version of that album I always listen to on my unethical streaming service of choice?; in staring at cassette stacks, sadly sitting in their obsolete state after only a few years of poorly timed prevalence? Maybe not the only one, but certainly a member of a shrinking minority. Perhaps the rapid decline of culture-rich, hole-in-the-wall, community-pillar, brick-and-mortar shops is not so pertinent to this discussion, but I nevertheless cannot help but dwell on it while appreciating the remains of a once-booming industry. 
	But I digress. I saw a CD that caught my eye from its blindingly #FFFF00 spine. I picked it up, noted that the cover looked cool, and decided to buy it [turns out this store is an outlet of TAANG! records, an old punk label, so the CD was only $5]. Spotting a cassette with a similarly yellow packaging contrasted sublimely with its grayscale cover, I went on my way with about 5 dollars left in my wallet, and 2 punk records. 
	Ever since that adventure [well, about 28 hours], I have been craving to go back and buy more records. The CD ["Land of the Lost" by The Freeze] is a succinct 25-minute head-thrasher which I've had on repeat. Currenty the only way I can listen to cassettes is in my friend's car, so I haven't checked out my other purchase ["Hate Your Friends" by Lemonheads] yet. Hopefully I will provide an update the next time I visit Taang!, as well as the other shops I plan on checking out.
